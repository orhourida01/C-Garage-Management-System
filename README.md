# Garage Management System (C Language)

A command-line application developed in **C** to manage a vehicle inventory efficiently. This project demonstrates core computer science concepts and low-level programming.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Custom Data Structures:** Uses `struct` to model vehicle data (Make, Model, Year, Type).
* **Dynamic Memory Management:** Implements `malloc()` and `free()` to handle memory allocation based on user input.
* **Modular Code:** Organized into functions for data entry and display for better readability and maintenance.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
The system asks the user for the number of vehicles, then dynamically allocates the exact memory needed. This ensures optimal performance and demonstrates a deep understanding of memory safety and pointers in C.
